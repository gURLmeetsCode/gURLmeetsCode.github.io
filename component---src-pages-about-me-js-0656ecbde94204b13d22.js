While there I played a key role in the campus expansions across North and Latin America. I grew curious about technology and building websites. It was at this time, I decided to attend workshops and meetups to build on my knowledge and gage if this was something I could do full time. Shortly after, I moved back to NYC and started working for a non-profit and was responsible for maintaining their public facing website in addition to helping develop their e-commerce site. This experience is what prompted me to apply to Grace Hopper. Grace Hopper has now given me the skills and confidence to reach my professional goals. I am so excited to work on real world problems and learn more about how data can help make more informed decisions.")))))}}}]);
