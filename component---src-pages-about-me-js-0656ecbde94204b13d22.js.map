While\n            there I played a key role in the campus expansions across North and\n            Latin America. I grew curious about technology and building\n            websites. It was at this time, I decided to attend workshops and\n            meetups to build on my knowledge and gage if this was something I\n            could do full time. Shortly after, I moved back to NYC and started\n            working for a non-profit and was responsible for maintaining their\n            public facing website in addition to helping develop their\n            e-commerce site. This experience is what prompted me to apply to\n            Grace Hopper. Grace Hopper has now given me the skills and\n            confidence to reach my professional goals. I am so excited to work\n            on real world problems and learn more about how data can help make\n            more informed decisions.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default AboutMe\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
